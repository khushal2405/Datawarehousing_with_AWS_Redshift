# Datawarehousing_with_AWS_Redshift
Data Warehousing using AWS Redshift

In this project we use ETL pipeline to populate the sparkifydb database in AWS Redshift.

The purpose of this database is to enable Sparkify to answer business questions it may have of its users, the types of songs they listen to and the artists of those songs using the data that it has in logs and files. The database provides a consistent and reliable source to store this data.

This source of data will be useful in helping Sparkify reach some of its analytical goals, for example, finding out songs that have highest popularity or times of the day which is high in traffic.
